#  Python Project 5: Read & Write CSV and Excel Files   

#  Problem Statement:  
# Create a Python script that can read data from a CSV file and write it to an Excel file (and vice versa).

#  What You'll Learn:  
# - Reading CSV using pandas  
# - Writing Excel files using ExcelWriter  
# - File handling and data manipulation  

#  Python Code:  
 
import pandas as pd

# Read data from CSV
csv_data = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print("CSV Data:")
print(csv_data)

# Write to Excel
csv_data.to_excel("data_output.xlsx", index=False)

# Read back from Excel
excel_data = pd.read_excel("data_output.xlsx")
print("\nExcel Data:")
print(excel_data)


#  How It Works:  
# - Reads data.csv file  
# - Converts and saves it as an Excel file  
# - Reads the Excel file to confirm successful write

#  Try modifying:  
# – Add filters or sorting  
# – Select specific columns  
# – Append new rows before saving  

#  Use Cases:  
# – Convert CSV sales reports to Excel  
# – Clean and reformat exported data  
# – Automate data handling tasks
